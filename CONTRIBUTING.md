# Contributing to herdctl

Contributions are welcome. Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, documentation improvement, or test coverage, we appreciate the help.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (used for workspace management)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/edspencer/herdctl
cd herdctl

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type check
pnpm typecheck
```

## Running Locally

To test your changes by running herdctl from the command line, you need to link the CLI package globally and start the dev watcher.

### Link the CLI globally

```bash
cd packages/cli
pnpm link --global
```

This creates a global symlink so that when you type `herdctl` anywhere on your machine, it runs the code from your local clone. You can verify it worked:

```bash
which herdctl              # should point to your pnpm global bin
herdctl --version          # should match the version in packages/cli/package.json
```

### Start the dev watcher

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs `turbo dev`, which starts `tsc --watch` in every package simultaneously. When you edit a `.ts` file, the TypeScript compiler recompiles it to the `dist/` directory automatically.

### How it all fits together

The monorepo uses pnpm's `workspace:*` protocol for inter-package dependencies. This means `@herdctl/core`, `@herdctl/web`, `@herdctl/discord`, `@herdctl/slack`, and `@herdctl/chat` all resolve to the local `packages/` directories rather than npm. The full chain looks like:

```
herdctl (global symlink)
  → packages/cli/bin/herdctl.js
    → packages/cli/dist/index.js (compiled from src/)
      → @herdctl/core → packages/core/dist/
      → @herdctl/web → packages/web/dist/
      → @herdctl/discord → packages/discord/dist/
      → @herdctl/slack → packages/slack/dist/
      → @herdctl/chat → packages/chat/dist/
```

Save a file, wait for `tsc --watch` to recompile, and the next `herdctl` invocation runs your new code. No manual build or reinstall step needed.

### Initial build

The dev watcher only recompiles files that change. On a fresh clone you need an initial full build before `pnpm dev` will work:

```bash
pnpm build
```

After that, `pnpm dev` handles incremental recompilation.

## Project Structure

The repository is a pnpm monorepo with packages under `packages/`:

- `packages/core/` — `@herdctl/core` (fleet management library)
- `packages/cli/` — `herdctl` (CLI)
- `packages/web/` — `@herdctl/web` (web dashboard)
- `packages/chat/` — `@herdctl/chat` (shared chat infrastructure)
- `packages/discord/` — `@herdctl/discord` (Discord connector)
- `packages/slack/` — `@herdctl/slack` (Slack connector)
- `docs/` — documentation site (Astro/Starlight)

## Changesets

Every change to a published package requires a changeset. Without one, the release pipeline will not publish new versions.

After making changes to any package under `packages/`:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Select the affected packages, the semver bump type (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`), and write a short description. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file along with your code.

## Quality Gates

All of the following must pass before a PR can be merged:

- `pnpm typecheck` — no TypeScript errors
- `pnpm test` — tests pass with coverage thresholds met
- `pnpm build` — all packages build successfully

## Testing

The repository includes both unit tests (Vitest) and integration tests (Playwright).

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are colocated with source files in `__tests__/` directories. Run them with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Web Integration Tests

The `@herdctl/web` package includes a comprehensive Playwright end-to-end test suite that boots a real Fastify server, FleetManager, and fake `claude` binary to test the web dashboard in a real browser with zero Anthropic API calls. See `packages/web/test-ui/README.md` for details.

```bash
# Build core and web first
pnpm --filter @herdctl/core... build
pnpm --filter @herdctl/web build

# Run the UI/integration suite
pnpm --filter @herdctl/web test:ui
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes and add a changeset if applicable.
3. Ensure all quality gates pass locally.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change.

For large changes or new features, please open an issue or start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/edspencer/herdctl/discussions) first so we can align on the approach before you invest significant effort.
