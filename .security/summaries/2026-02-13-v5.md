# Executive Security Summary
**Date**: 2026-02-13 (v5)
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive Daily Audit
**Overall Status**: 🟡 YELLOW

---

## Bottom Line

System security posture is **STABLE** with **6 tracked findings**, all pre-existing. No new vulnerabilities introduced. Primary concern is unbounded growth of security audit job files requiring cleanup policy implementation.

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Security Status | 🟡 YELLOW | → Stable |
| Critical Findings | 0 | ✅ None |
| High Findings | 2 | → (1 accepted, 1 tracked) |
| Medium Findings | 3 | → (2 accepted, 1 tracked) |
| Low Findings | 1 | → (tech debt) |
| Commits Analyzed | 1 | (docs only) |
| bypassPermissions Count | 61 | ⬆️ +6 from v4 |

---

## Critical Issues

**None**. All findings are known and tracked.

---

## Attention Required

### HIGH Priority

**Finding #010: bypassPermissions Growth**
- **Current**: 61 job files (up from 55, +10.9%)
- **Trend**: +42 files/day, accelerating
- **Projection**: ~294 files in 7 days if unchecked
- **Risk**: Low (all are audit jobs, expected behavior)
- **Action**: **Implement job cleanup policy** - Retain only last 7 days or 10 files/day
- **Urgency**: Short-term (before hitting 100 files)

### MEDIUM Priority

**Manual Verification Needed**:
1. **npm audit** (Finding #008) - Scanner cannot parse pnpm output
2. **Webhook authentication** (Q1) - Implementation status unknown
3. **Container user config** (Q7) - Document security implications

---

## What Changed

### Since Last Audit (v4, 2 hours ago)
- **Code Changes**: None (1 commit was audit documentation)
- **Scanner Results**: +6 bypassPermissions files detected
- **Security Posture**: Unchanged (YELLOW)
- **New Vulnerabilities**: 0

### Growth Analysis
- bypassPermissions files: 19 → 61 (+221% in 24 hours)
- All growth is in `.herdctl/jobs/` (security audit subagent jobs)
- Expected behavior but requires cleanup to prevent unbounded accumulation

---

## Findings Breakdown

### Accepted Risks (HIGH Severity)
- **#002**: hostConfigOverride (3 locations) - Required for fleet-level Docker config

### Tracked Issues (HIGH Severity)
- **#010**: bypassPermissions in 61 job files - Expected, needs cleanup policy

### Accepted Risks (MEDIUM Severity)
- **#005**: bypassPermissions in example config - Intentional demo
- **#006**: shell:true in hook runner - Required for shell hooks

### Tracked Issues (MEDIUM Severity)
- **#008**: npm audit parser error - Manual verification needed

### Tech Debt (LOW Severity)
- **#009**: Incomplete shell escaping - Low priority fix

---

## Scanner Summary

```
✅ PASS: path-safety (3ms)
✅ PASS: env-handling (87ms)
⚠️ WARN: npm-audit (2ms) - Parser error
⚠️ WARN: subprocess-patterns (29ms) - Accepted risks
❌ FAIL: docker-config (132ms) - Accepted risk
❌ FAIL: permission-modes (25ms) - Tracked growth
```

**Total Duration**: 291ms

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Implement job cleanup policy** to prevent unbounded growth
2. Run manual `pnpm audit` to verify dependency status
3. Confirm only one audit orchestrator is running (check for parallel executions)

### Short-Term (Next 7 Days)
1. Investigate webhook authentication implementation (Q1)
2. Document Docker container user configuration (Q7)
3. Set monitoring threshold: alert if bypassPermissions exceeds 100 files

### Long-Term (Next 30 Days)
1. Fix shell escaping tech debt (Finding #009)
2. Improve scanner to parse pnpm audit output (Finding #008)
3. Implement automated job lifecycle management

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

- No critical vulnerabilities
- All high-severity findings are tracked/accepted
- Growth pattern is understood and expected
- Codebase security fundamentals are sound

**Primary Concern**: Operational hygiene (job file accumulation) rather than active security threats.

---

## Next Audit

**When**: Tomorrow (2026-02-14) or after 10+ commits

**Focus Areas**:
1. Verify job cleanup policy implemented
2. Monitor bypassPermissions file count
3. Check for any production code changes
4. Continue tracking Finding #010 trend

---

## Conclusion

🟡 **YELLOW status is appropriate**. System is secure with tracked findings requiring operational attention but no immediate security threats. Recommend implementing job cleanup before next audit to maintain operational health.

**Cleared for continued development**: Yes, with job cleanup as next priority task.
