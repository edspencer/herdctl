## Active Findings (unchanged)

### High Priority
- **#010**: bypassPermissions in 51 audit job files (was 41)
  - Status: TRACKED - Expected behavior from security audit workflow
  - Trend: 19→41→51 files over 2 days
  - Assessment: Intentional, no risk

- **#002**: hostConfigOverride can bypass Docker hardening
  - Status: ACCEPTED RISK - Required for advanced fleet configs
  - Mitigation: Documented, only fleet-level

### Medium Priority
- **Q1**: Webhook authentication status unknown
- **Q4**: Log injection via agent output possible
- **Q7**: Container user configuration (root?)
- **#008**: npm audit parser issue - manual check needed

### Low Priority
- **#009**: Incomplete shell escaping in Docker prompts (tech debt)
- **Q3**: Container name special character handling

---

## Changes Since Last Audit

**Code commits**: 0
**Job activity**: +6 job files created today (normal audit operations)
**Risk introduced**: NONE

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (None)
All findings are tracked and understood. No blocking issues.

### This Week
1. Investigate Q1 (webhook authentication)
2. Investigate Q4 (log injection risks)
3. Run manual `pnpm audit` to verify #008

### Future
1. Investigate Q7 (container user)
2. Fix #009 (shell escaping) when convenient
3. Continue monitoring #010 trend

## Metrics

- **Total findings**: 6 active (unchanged)
- **Critical**: 0
- **High**: 2 (1 tracked, 1 accepted)
- **Medium**: 4 (3 accepted/tracked, 1 question)
- **Low**: 2 (tech debt)
- **Open questions**: 9 (0 high, 8 medium, 1 low)

---

## Status Explanation

**🟡 YELLOW** because:
- Scanner shows "FAIL" status (2 failed checks)
- High-severity finding #010 is present
- However, all findings are **known, tracked, and understood**

**NOT RED** because:
- No new vulnerabilities introduced
- No code changes occurred
- Finding #010 is expected behavior (audit jobs need elevated permissions)
- All high-severity risks are documented and accepted

**NOT GREEN** because:
- Scanner has 2 failed checks and 2 warnings
- 6 active findings require ongoing attention
- Medium-priority questions need investigation

---

## Next Audit

**Recommended timing**: Next code commit or 24 hours (whichever comes first)

**Focus areas**:
- Monitor bypassPermissions trend
- Check for any code changes to security-critical areas
- Investigate 1-2 medium-priority questions if time permits
