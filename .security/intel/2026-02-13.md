# Security Intelligence Report - 2026-02-13

**Review Type**: Incremental (Automated)
**Triggered By**: security-auditor agent
**Branch**: feature/simplify-security-fleet-yaml
**Overall Result**: WARN

---

## Executive Summary

Scanner detected **significant increase in bypassPermissions usage** - from 19 to 41 production job config files (116% increase overnight). All other findings remain consistent with yesterday's audit. No code changes since last audit (only audit commit present). This is a YELLOW/WARN status requiring investigation of job creation activity.

## Scanner Results

**Status**: FAIL
**Duration**: 285ms

| Check | Status | Findings |
|-------|--------|----------|

| docker-config | FAIL | 3 (high severity - hostConfigOverride) |
| permission-modes | FAIL | 2 (1 high, 1 low - bypassPermissions) |
| subprocess-patterns | WARN | 4 (2 medium, 2 low - shell usage) |
| path-safety | PASS | 0 |
| env-handling | PASS | 0 |

**Resolved since last audit**: 0

### Critical Change Detected

**Finding #010 ESCALATED**: bypassPermissions usage increased significantly

- **Yesterday (2026-02-12)**: 19 production config files
- **Today (2026-02-13)**: 41 production config files
- **Change**: +22 files (+116% increase)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Recommendation**: Investigate job creation activity between 2026-02-12 17:03 and 2026-02-13 00:04

**New job files detected** (sample from scan output):
- `.herdctl/jobs/job-2026-02-12-adqqc2.yaml` (2 instances at lines 40, 93)
- `.herdctl/jobs/job-2026-02-12-uddt5o.yaml` (4 instances at lines 24, 50, 52, 66)
- `.herdctl/jobs/job-2026-02-12-c8zfz8.yaml` (2 instances at lines 32, 78)
- `.herdctl/jobs/job-2026-02-12-5ox38f.yaml` (8 instances - most concerning)
- And 18 more files...

**Analysis**: The daily security audit on 2026-02-12 appears to have spawned multiple subagent jobs that used bypassPermissions mode. This is expected for security audit workflow but confirms the finding is accurate - the security fleet itself uses bypassPermissions extensively.

## Change Analysis

**Commits since last audit**: 1 (audit commit only)
**Risk Level**: NONE (no functional code changes)

**Commit analyzed**:
- `1355641 security: daily audit 2026-02-12 - YELLOW status`

## Session Statistics

- Scanner runtime: 285ms
- Change-analyzer spawned: NO (no meaningful code changes)
- Hot-spot-verifier spawned: NO (no hot spots modified)
- Question-investigator spawned: NO (no High priority questions)
- Total duration: <5 seconds
- Commits analyzed: 1 (audit commit only)
- Questions investigated: 0

---

## Actionable Items

### Immediate
1. **Review Finding #010 escalation**: Confirm that bypassPermissions increase is from security audit job spawning (expected behavior)
2. **Consider**: Should security audit jobs use Docker isolation instead of bypassPermissions?

### This Week
3. Investigate Q1 (webhook authentication) - Medium priority
4. Verify npm audit parser issue (#008) - run `pnpm audit` manually
