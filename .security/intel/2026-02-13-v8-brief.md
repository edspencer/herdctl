**Time**: 14:04 UTC
**Type**: On-Demand Audit
**Trigger**: User requested via `/security-audit-daily`

## Executive Summary

🟡 **YELLOW Status** - Stable security posture, all findings tracked

- **Code changes**: ZERO (1 artifact-only commit since v6)
- **New findings**: ZERO
- **Regressions**: ZERO
- **bypassPermissions trend**: STABILIZING (+2.9% vs +13.1% previous)

## Scanner Results

```
Total checks: 6  |  Passed: 2  |  Warned: 2  |  Failed: 2
Execution time: 295ms
```

### Finding Summary
- Critical: 0
- High: 2 (tracked/accepted)
- Medium: 3 (tracked/accepted)
- Low: 2 (tech debt)

## Key Observations

### 1. bypassPermissions Growth Trend (Finding #010)
**Status**: Growth rate STABILIZING

| Version | Count | Delta | Growth Rate |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| v5 | 61 | +6 | +10.9% |
| v6 | 69 | +8 | +13.1% |
| **v8** | **71** | **+2** | **+2.9%** |

**Analysis**:
- Growth rate decreased from +13.1% to +2.9%
- Indicates audit job creation is slowing or cleanup is occurring
- 43 total job files in .herdctl/jobs/ (down from previous counts)
- Continues to be expected behavior from security audit jobs

**Recommendation**: Monitor trend but no immediate action needed. Job cleanup policy remains medium priority.

### 2. Code Stability
- Zero code changes to packages/ since v6 (6fb7760)
- All critical hot spots unchanged
- No new security issues introduced

### 3. Scanner Performance
- 295ms execution (stable vs v6: 288ms)
- All checks completed successfully
- No parser errors or check failures

## Commits Analyzed

**Range**: 6fb7760..d9b968a (1 commit)

| Commit | Type | Security Impact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| d9b968a | Security artifacts | ZERO |

**Analysis**: Commit only contains security audit artifacts from v6. No production code changes.

## Hot Spot Verification

All 5 critical security hot spots verified unchanged:

| Hot Spot | Status | Last Change |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| container-manager.ts | ✅ Unchanged | Prior to v6 |
| docker-config.ts | ✅ Unchanged | Prior to v6 |
| container-runner.ts | ✅ Unchanged | Prior to v6 |
| shell.ts (hook runner) | ✅ Unchanged | Prior to v6 |
| path-safety.ts | ✅ Unchanged | Prior to v6 |

## Findings Status

All findings remain in same state as v6:

| ID | Severity | Status | Change |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| #002 | High | Accepted risk | No change |
| #006 | Medium | Accepted risk | No change |
| #008 | Medium | Tracked | No change |
| #009 | Low | Tech debt | No change |
| #010 | High | **Tracked** | **71 files (+2, +2.9%)** |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (None)
No immediate action required.

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. **Job cleanup policy** - 43 job files, 71 bypassPermissions occurrences
2. **Manual npm audit** - Verify dependencies (scanner cannot parse pnpm output)

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. **Shell escaping enhancement** (#009)
2. **Example config documentation** (bypassPermissions in examples/)

## Next Audit

**Baseline**: d9b968a
**Trigger**: Next scheduled run or code changes
**Focus areas**:
- Continue monitoring bypassPermissions trend
- Verify if job cleanup policy implemented
- Check for any code changes to hot spots
